				<h2>My Story</h2>				

				<p>I was born in Attleboro Massachusetts where I attended high-school at <a href="https://www.gracebaptistchristianacademy.org/">Grace Baptist Christian Academy</a>. 

My family moved to Newington Connecticut while I was studying accounting at <a href=" https://www.bju.edu/guide/?gclid=CjwKCAjwldHsBRAoEiwAd0JybYSftgYai0a_eSFZ2qipzr8yYBdF-4uuodNoELtuicY0o3laQv5PDhoCkBAQAvD_BwE">Bob Jones University</a>. 

Recently I have been working as a supervisor for <a href="https://www.saputo.com/">Saputo</a> in a milk and ice cream pasteurizing plant.</p>

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

				<p>My favorite thing to do is play sports. I played soccer and basketball all throughout high-school, and I played soccer in college for the <a href="https://www.bjubruins.com/">Bruins</a> Now I enjoy playing golf. I also enjoy reading books about U.S. History.</p>
